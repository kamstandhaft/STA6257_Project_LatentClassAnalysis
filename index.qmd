## 1. Introduction

Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is a statistical modeling method that can be
utilized when it is believed that there may be unobserved subgroups
(classes) among the individuals within a population. To identify these
unobserved groups, LCA searches for and analyzes response patterns that
may exist within categorical variables reported in the dataset
([Nylund-Gibson & Choi, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1037/tps0000176)).
Latent Class Analysis is an example of a broader class of models called
finite mixture models(FFM) (Grimm et al., 2021) that seek to identify
and classify instances of variance within model parameters between
groups within the data that have not been explicitly defined as groups
by the attributes provided within the dataset itself.

LCA specifically makes the assumption that within the population
potentially exists a finite number of unobserved subgroups, or latent
classes, and that each individual belongs to only one of these classes
([Weller et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1177/0095798420930932)). The
overarching goal of LCA is to identify where a specific subset of
classes exist within a group and estimate the proportions of those
subset classes within the overall population. Additionally, LCA can be
used to help determine if any relationships exist between the identified
latent classes and any other observed variables within the dataset.

As computational efficiency has improved, Latent Class Analysis has seen
an uptick in interest for researchers across a variety of fields with
applications in science, business, and health ([Petersen et al.,
2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01214)). LCA is often most
closely associated with identifying patterns of behavior or
psychological characteristics that prove often otherwise difficult
groups to identify(Kaplan et al., 2004).

### 1.1 LCA Applications

One frequent application of Latent Class Analysis (LCA) has been to
utilize it to identify subgroups of individuals within a population that
may have similar or associated symptoms or characteristics of a mental
health profile ([Petersen et al.,
2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01214)) or when and which
specific barriers may exist to receiving medical care ([Thorpe et al.,
2011](https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6963-11-181)). LCA has also been used
to identify when any subgroups of a population exist containing
individuals that may have different risk factors or potential outcomes
of a particular disease or disease pattern ([Petersen et al.,
2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01214)). Outside of health
field applications, Latent Class Analysis can also be used in business
and marketing to assess buying habits and even latent classes for groups
with preferences for specific types of products (Kaplan et al., 2004).

### 1.2 Challenges with Implementation and Analysis of Classes using LCA

LCA has the ability to use mixture-modeling to distinguish and label
instances of heterogeneity within a population and to identify subgroups
of characteristics or individuals that may be more likely to exhibit
those characteristics of heterogeneity ([Weller et al.,
2020](https://doi.org/10.1177/0095798420930932)). Identifying and
labeling subgroups of a population that may not be explicitly obvious
based upon its reported attributes has substantial application for
helping to identify individuals within that population who may be at
greater risk or likelihood for a particular outcome. This application
can help drive execution of actions that may require intervention
([Petersen et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01214)).

Latent class Analysis has application across a variety of fields, but
there are also limitations that exist with to its use under certain
circumstances that can prove challenging to its implementation. One of
the major challenges that exist in any attempted implementation of this
method, is being able to determine the appropriate number of latent
classes. Doing so can prove time intensive and cumbersome, as the
process can be somewhat subjective and often requires using a multi-step
process to test multiple models and/or number of classes ([Asparouhov &
Muth√©n, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2014.915181).
Interpretation of the classes themselves that were generated can also
provide some significant challenge as it may require knowledge of not
only the implementation methodology of the LCA upon the data but also
requires that the analyst have access to background information about
the data attributes and context ([Weller et al.,
2020](https://doi.org/10.1177/0095798420930932)). Though a class may be
correctly identified, if the researcher/analyst does not correctly
identify what is heterogenous about that class, it can lead to improper
naming and assumptions about the defining characteristics of the members
of that class for analysis ([Weller et al.,
2020](https://doi.org/10.1177/0095798420930932)).

## 2. Methods

The general steps to use latent class analysis are as follows:

1.Identify the research question and define the variables Define the
categorical variables that will be used in the analysis

2.Select the appropriate software: In this project R Studio will be used
for the LCA

3.Determine the number of latent classes

4.Estimate the model: Estimate the model parameters using maximum
likelihood estimation or Bayesian estimation

5.Evaluate the model: After estimating the model, evaluate its fit using
goodness-of-fit statistics such as the likelihood ratio test, Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
If our model fits well, interpret the results and report the estimated
probabilities of individuals belonging to each class.

6.Conduct sensitivity analysis: Finally, conduct sensitivity analyses to
test the robustness of the results and evaluate the stability of the
estimated probabilities across different subgroups or samples.

## 3. Analysis and Results

### 3.1 Dataset Description

For the purpose of this paper, we are using a dataset from Kaggle called
Zoo Animals
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/zoo-animals). There
are 101 entries and a total of 18 variables in this dataset.The
variables give information about the physical attributes of each of the
animals, such as if they have hair, if they have teeth, if they lay
eggs, etc. Of the 18 variables, 15 of them are binary variables and one
of them is discrete. This majority of binary variables is why we chose
this dataset for Latent Class Analysis.

The variable that we are concerned with the most is the "type" variable.
This variable has 7 categories: mammals, fish, birds, insects, reptiles,
invertebrates, amphibians. Of the 101 entries, 42 are mammals (41.58%),
21 are birds (20.79%), 14 are fish (13.86%), 11 are invertebrates
(10.89%), 8 are insects (7.92%), 6 are reptiles (5.94%), and 5 are
amphibians (4.95%).

Among other variables, we will be removing the "type" variable from the
dataset. Latent Class Analysis will be utilized to ascertain whether the
groups identified by this method correspond to the seven animal types.

Variables considered in LCA Analysis:

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=T, message=FALSE}
library(formattable)

tab_lca_var <- data.frame(var_num = 1:14, 
   Variable = c('hair', 'feathers','eggs','milk','airborne','aquatic',
               'predator','toothed','backbone','breathes','venomous',
               'fins','tail','has_legs'),
   Variable_Description = c('Has hair?','has feathers?','Lays eggs?',
                           'Produces milk?','Can fly?','Can swim?',
                           'Is a predator?','Has teeth?','Has a backbone?',
                           'Animal breathes?','Has venom?','Has fins?',
                           'Has a tail?','Has legs?'))
formattable(tab_lca_var)

```

Variables in original dataset, but not used in LCA models:

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=T, message=FALSE}
tab_nonlca_var <- data.frame(var_num = 1:4, 
   Variable = c('animal', 'domestic','catsize','type'),
   Variable_Description = c('Animal Name','Commonly domesticated?',
                            'About the size of a cat?',
                           'Animal Classification'))
formattable(tab_nonlca_var)

```

### 3.2 Load Necessary Packages

When the data is first loaded, with each categorical variable, there is
an apostrophe and a "b" before each word and at the end, there is an
apostrophe. The data were cleaned into the file Zoo_clean with these
extra characters removed leaving only "TRUE" & "FALSE".

All Necessary Libraries are loaded here:

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=T, message=FALSE}
# loading packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggrepel)
library(dslabs)
library(poLCA)
library(stats)
library(sjPlot)
library(knitr)
```

### 3.2 Load Data

Below is where we import the cleaned dataset without the apostrophes or
the "b"s.

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
Zoo_clean<- (read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamstandhaft/STA6257_Project_LatentClassAnalysis/main/Zoo_clean.csv"))

new_zoo <- Zoo_clean %>% mutate(animal=NULL, domestic=NULL, catsize=NULL, type=NULL)
view(new_zoo)

```

### 3.3 Data Preparation

As mentioned above, we will be removing the "type" variable from the
dataset with the goal of trying to replicate this level of
classification through the latent class detection. The identifier
variable "animal" will also be removed. Finally, we only want objective
binary variables in our dataset, so we will also be removing "catsize"
and "domestic" from the dataset, and transforming legs (denoting the
number of legs a creature has) to has_legs (a binary operator indicating
whether any legs are present or not).

We will be using the poLCA function from the poLCA package library,
which requires an input of positive integer values \<=1. As such, we
transformed our dataset from logical operators TRUE/FALSE to binary
integers 0/1. But as poLCA function cannot accept "0" as a value, we
further transformed the data by incrementing all values by 1, wherein
"FALSE" is represented by "1", and "TRUE" is represented by "2".

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Adding attribute has_legs to denote whether the animal has a leg count >0
new_zoo <- Zoo_clean %>%
  mutate(has_legs = ifelse(legs == 0, 0, 1))

# Removing the non-binary integer representing the number of legs an animal has
new_zoo <- new_zoo %>%
  mutate(legs = NULL)

# Transforming has_legs to a logical operator to match the rest of the dataset 
#        to be used in assessment
new_zoo$has_legs <- as.logical(new_zoo$has_legs)

# Creating a 14-variable subset of the 18-variable dataset with "animal", 
#       "domestic", "catsize", and "type" removed
new_zoo_subset <- new_zoo %>% mutate(animal=NULL, domestic=NULL, 
                                     catsize=NULL, type=NULL)

# Creating a dataset where the binary data is represented by 
#       integers "0" for "FALSE" or "1" for "TRUE"
new_zoo_int <- new_zoo_subset %>% mutate_all(~as.integer(.))

# Creating a dataset where the binary data is represented by 
#        integers "1" for "FALSE" or "2" for "TRUE"
new_zoo_int_1 <- new_zoo_int %>% mutate_all(~. + 1)
```

## 4. Statistical Modeling

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# cbind function used to bind Columns being used in LCA
lca_bind <-  cbind(hair, feathers, eggs, milk, 
                   airborne, aquatic, predator, 
                   toothed, backbone, breathes, 
                   venomous, fins, tail, has_legs) ~ 1
```

### 4.1 Fitting LCA Models with \# of Classes from 2-7

Fitting a 2-class LCA Model

For the 2-class model, we have selected to display the output of the
poLCA model results using the \[verbose = TRUE\] option.

For each variable, this indicates the percentage of "TRUE" & "FALSE"
values. These are represented graphically for the remainder of the
models.

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Fitting a 2-class LCA Model
lca_fit2 <- poLCA(lca_bind, data = new_zoo_int_1, 
                  nclass = 2, graphs = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Fitting a 3-class LCA Model

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Fitting a 3-class LCA Model
lca_fit3 <- poLCA(lca_bind, data = new_zoo_int_1, 
                  nclass = 3, graphs = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
```

Fitting a 4-class LCA Model

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
lca_fit4 <- poLCA(lca_bind, data = new_zoo_int_1, 
                  nclass = 4, graphs = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
```

Fitting a 5-class LCA Model

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
lca_fit5 <- poLCA(lca_bind, data = new_zoo_int_1, 
                  nclass = 5, graphs = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE,verbose = FALSE)
```

Fitting a 6-class LCA Model

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
lca_fit6 <- poLCA(lca_bind, data = new_zoo_int_1, 
                  nclass = 6, graphs = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE,verbose = FALSE)
```

Fitting a 7-class LCA Model

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
lca_fit7 <- poLCA(lca_bind, data = new_zoo_int_1, 
                  nclass = 7, graphs = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE,verbose = FALSE)
```

### 4.2 Model Comparison Statistics

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Discuss the AIC, BIC, GoF Test -> how arrived at 5-Class model
```
