## What is Latent Class Analysis (LCA)?

## Usage of LCA

## Methods

## Our dataset {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Data Overview

To assess the effectiveness of Latent Class Analysis, we used the 'Zoo Animals' dataset from Kaggle. This dataset has 101 entries and is an ideal choice because of its majority of binary variables.

### Dropped/Changed Variables {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Dropped**

There were 2 variables (Catsize and Domestic) that we dropped because we thought they were subjective. And we dropped the 'Animal' variable because it was an identifier.

**Changed**

There was one variable in our dataset that was discrete, so we changed it to a binary variable.

### Dataset
To perform our analysis, we are using these 14 variables.

## Our goal{.smaller}

We are not including the 'type' variable in our analysis. Instead we are going to use its different categories (mammal, bird, reptile, fish, insects, amphibian, invertebrate) as the classes in our Latent Class Analysis.

```{r}
library(readr)
Zoo_clean <- read_csv("Zoo_clean.csv")

type_table <- table(Zoo_clean$type)

type_prop <- prop.table(type_table)

pie(type_table, labels = paste(names(type_table), formatC(type_prop*100, format = 'f', digits = 1), '%', sep = '\n'))


```

### Possible Number of Classes

In order to determine the optimal number of classes that would best model our dataset, we conducted a series of analyses beginning with 2 classes and concluding at 7 classes, which was the number of different types of animals in the dataset. The code presented below was utilized to fit the model for each of the different number of classes.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

#Creating "has_legs" to denote whether the animal has a leg count >0 from "legs" variable
new_zoo <- Zoo_clean %>% mutate(has_legs = ifelse(legs == 0, 0, 1))

#Removing "legs" since it is continuous and not binary
new_zoo <- new_zoo %>% mutate(legs = NULL)

#Converting has_legs from integer to logical to match the rest of the dataset
new_zoo$has_legs <- as.logical(new_zoo$has_legs)

#Removing "animal","domestic", "catsize", and "type" from 18-variable dataset to make new 14-variable dataset for LCA modeling  
new_zoo_subset <- new_zoo %>% mutate(animal=NULL, domestic=NULL, 
                                     catsize=NULL, type=NULL)

#Creating a dataset where the binary data is converted to integers 0/"FALSE" or 1/"TRUE"
new_zoo_int <- new_zoo_subset %>% mutate_all(~as.integer(.))

#Incrementing the binary integers from 0/1 to 1/2 - poLCA() can only accept integers >=1
new_zoo_int_1 <- new_zoo_int %>% mutate_all(~. + 1)

lca_bind <-  cbind(hair, feathers, eggs, milk, 
                   airborne, aquatic, predator, 
                   toothed, backbone, breathes, 
                   venomous, fins, tail, has_legs) ~ 1
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}

library(poLCA)

lca_fit2 <- poLCA(lca_bind, data = new_zoo_int_1, 
                  nclass = 2, graphs = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE, 
                  nrep=100, maxiter=100, verbose = FALSE)
```
