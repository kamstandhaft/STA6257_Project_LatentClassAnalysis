## What is Latent Class Analysis (LCA)?

## Usage of LCA

## Methods

## Our dataset {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Data Overview

We used a dataset from Kaggle called 'Zoo Animals.' This dataset was an ideal choice because of all of the binary variables.

### Dropped/Changed Variables {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Dropped**

There were 2 variables (Catsize and Domestic) that we dropped because we thought they were subjective. And we dropped the 'Animal' variable because it was an identifier.

**Changed**

There was one variable in our dataset that was discrete, so we changed it to a binary variable.
